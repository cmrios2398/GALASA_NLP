# GALASA_NLP
One of the significant challenges that users experience when employing a new product is the steep learning curve in understanding the tool itself. This is commonly resolved by providing extensive documentation but can oftentimes result in users not knowing where to find the answer to their questions. This project tries to solve this challenge on GALASA, a new open-source IBM test tool which has been recently released. There is information around the tool to support users in its usage, but this is a mixture of accredited guides and unofficial user information contained within website and GitHub docs, spectrum channels and forums. This report relates the research carried out and the design and deployment of an AI assistant that can receive input in unstructured format (user questions) and then provide both specific answers to most asked questions, and where the answer is not contained in the AI Assistant flow, can then use Natural Language Processing to analyse the available documentation to point the user to the most relevant document relating to their query.
